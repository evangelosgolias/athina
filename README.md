# Athina

**Athina** is a data analysis package for the experiments performed at the MAXPEEM beamline of MAXIV, using Igor Pro from Wavemetrics. 
The package is being developed using Igor Pro 9. A small subset of the code could run on earlier versions of Igor Pro (for example: the proprietary Elmitexc .dat file loader) but not the package .**Athina**.

## Getting started

### Installation

Download the repo and unpack. You have two options for installation:

### Option 1 (Auto)

Copy the **src/MAXPEEM** folder to:

*Windows*:
C:\Users\UserName\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files\Igor Procedures

*Mac*:
/Users/UserName/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files/Igor Procedures

** Athina will automatically load when you launch Igor Pro.**

### Option 2 (Manual)

Copy the **MXP_StartUp.ipf** file to:

*Windows*:
C:\Users\UserName\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files\Igor Procedures

*Mac*:
/Users/UserName/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files/Igor Procedures

Copy the **src/MAXPEMM** folder in:

*Windows*:
C:\Users\UserName\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files\User Procedures

*Mac*:
/Users/UserName/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files/User Procedures

** To launch the package, choose Macros > Athina **

If you don't know where the folders are, choose Menubar > Help > Show Igor Pro User Files in Igor Pro.

_CAUTION: When you update you should delete the _MAXPEEM_ contents folder before copying the newer version, as filenames might differ in future versions._
