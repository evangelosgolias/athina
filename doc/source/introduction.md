# Introduction


Athina is a software package based on Igor Pro (verion 9 or newer) for the analysis of LEEM, LEED, PEEM, XPS, ARPES and XAS data. The motivation for Athina's development is the users of the MAXPEEM beamline at MAXIV synchrotron facilities, but it can be used by anyone who wants to analyse (photo-)electron microscopy data.
